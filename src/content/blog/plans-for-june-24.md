GnuLinuxIndia is excited to kick off our first project of the year! In
this article, we'll dive into the details of what's in store for us in
June.

### Project Overview

Our June project aims to create [InternetChowkidar](https://github.com/gnulinuxindia/internet-chowkidar), a tool that
aggregates data on Internet Service Provider (ISP) blockages. This
initiative is designed to monitor and record instances where certain
websites are blocked or restricted by different ISPs across various
regions.

### The Tool: A Browser Extension

To achieve this, we'll be building a browser extension that will
periodically check the availability of specific websites and send any
blocked site data back to our servers. This data will then be compiled
on a dedicated website, providing a comprehensive view of which sites
are blocked by which ISPs in each region.

### Website Features

The website will display a list of all blocked sites per region,
categorized by ISP. This information will be invaluable for users who
want to stay informed about potential blockages and restrictions in
their area.

### Why this Project Matters

This project has significant implications for online freedom, as it
will help users make informed decisions about which ISPs to use or
avoid. Additionally, the aggregated data can be used by advocacy
groups, researchers, and policymakers to identify trends and patterns
in ISP behavior, ultimately promoting a more open internet.

### Get Involved!

If you're interested in contributing to this project, please reach out
to us on our GLI channels, and the [git repository](https://github.com/gnulinuxindia/internet-chowkidar). We're looking for passionate
individuals like you to join the development process and help bring
this tool to life.

Stay tuned for updates on our project's progress, and let's make a
difference together!
