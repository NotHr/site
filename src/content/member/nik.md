### Hey, nik here!

I consider myself a programmer, a designer, and a bit of a Linux nerd. I also
enjoy reading long articles, obsessing over books, and listening to clich√© pop
music.

I write some code every now and then. I'm really interested in web technologies.
Most of my hobby projects are out there on public git repos (links below).
